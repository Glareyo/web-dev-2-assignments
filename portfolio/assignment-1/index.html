        <h1>_My Perspective on Web Authors_</h1>
        <h2>Nehemiah Cedillo, 2/3/2023</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>From my perspective, the role of web authors encompass several things aside from just developing websites. From my perspective, web authors seem to take on a more active role in shaping the web, not only through creating websites, but by also shaping how the web is for others, allowing other people to utilize tools on the web without limitations. </p>
        <p>In terms of society, web authors should still have an active role in development. As shown in the article, the internet and World Wide Web were developed to be open and free to everyone who wants to develop a website. With this, web authors have a significant role in society since the internet and the web are still developing to this day and is still being used and spread across the world. Due to this, from my perspective, web authors have an active, key role in terms of society in helping the web grow and shape itself for others to use openly and creatively.
        </p>
        <p>With this, the role of web authors seem to also play an important part in terms of giving access to those who are not web authors, allowing others to freely explore the web with little limitations imposed by Facebook or Google. This also plays the role of reinforcing the idea of keeping the openness of the web, allowing others to use the web as well.</p>
        <p>In business, web authors should also be active in its involvement. As the article states, Facebook and Google have been utilizing their own servers, allowing themselves to publish websites and keep it within their own servers, which can limit how web authors operate. As such, from my perspective, this seems to go against the openness of the web, which web authors should continue to get involved in the business side of the web.  </p>
        <p>Other than this, it also would allow others to freely explore the web with little limitations, rather than being stuck to a specific server like Facebook or Google. On the other hand this, the role of web authors also encompasses the role of business as well, since if specific servers, such as Facebook and google, have limitations or a variety of different tools, then web authors must be aware of these tools. This also means utilize the service that they can reliably create their websites and choosing which service best suits their needs. </p>
          <p>Other than this, by actively being involved in the business side of the web, it would help keep the web open to others to use, for either social reasons or business reasons. </p>
        <p>Overall, what is missing from the field is an open source or open, free server for web authors and development, allowing everyone to be able to access tools for web authoring. </p>
        <p>In terms of where it should be going, it should be pushed more towards being open and free for others to use. </p>
        <p>This can allow people to explore the web creatively and freely create websites without having to refer to the companies that influence the web. Additionally, this can allow equal access to the web, rather than people utilizing limited access and tools, such as the Facebook Basics. Alongside this, it can also allow other developing web authors to utilize common tools, reinforcing the original idea of the web being made for openness. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In conclusion, web authors play an active role in not only creating websites, but also in developing and shaping the Web into keeping it more open for others to utilize its tools and openness to creativity. In addition, web authors should continue taking an active role in the society and business side of the web, helping keep the original idea of the web going. </p>
