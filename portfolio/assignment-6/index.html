      <section id="section-1">
        <p>From my perspective, the role of web authors encompass several things aside from just developing websites.
          From my perspective, web authors seem to take on a more active role in shaping the web, not only through
          creating websites, but by also shaping how the web is for others, allowing other people to utilize tools on
          the web without limitations.
          In terms of society, web authors should still have an active role in development. As shown in the article,
          the internet and World Wide Web were developed to be open and free to everyone who wants to develop a website.
          With this, web authors have a significant role in society since the internet and the web are still developing
          to this day and is still being used and spread across the world. Due to this, from my perspective, web authors
          have an active, key role in terms of society in helping the web grow and shape itself for others to use openly
          and creatively.</p>

      <section id="section-2">
        <p id="section-2-p-1">With this, the role of web authors seem to also play an important part in terms of giving access to those who
          are not web authors, allowing others to freely explore the web with little limitations imposed by Facebook or
          Google. This also plays the role of reinforcing the idea of keeping the openness of the web, allowing others
          to use the web as well.</p>
        <p id="section-2-p-2">In business, web authors should also be active in its involvement. As the article states, Facebook and Google
          have been utilizing their own servers, allowing themselves to publish websites and keep it within their own
          servers, which can limit how web authors operate. As such, from my perspective, this seems to go against the
          openness of the web, which web authors should continue to get involved in the business side of the web. </p>

      <section id="section-3">
        <p>Other than this, it also would allow others to freely explore the web with little limitations, rather than
          being stuck to a specific server like Facebook or Google. On the other hand this, the role of web authors also
          encompasses the role of business as well, since if specific servers, such as Facebook and google, have
          limitations or a variety of different tools, then web authors must be aware of these tools. This also means
          utilize the service that they can reliably create their websites and choosing which service best suits their
          needs. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In conclusion, web authors play an active role in not only creating websites, but also in developing and
          shaping the Web into keeping it more open for others to utilize its tools and openness to creativity. In
          addition, web authors should continue taking an active role in the society and business side of the web,
          helping keep the original idea of the web going. </p>
