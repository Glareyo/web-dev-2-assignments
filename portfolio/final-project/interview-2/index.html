        <p>When it comes to hats, it seems simply straightforward. Find a hat, measure your head, see if it fits, and done, you now have a hat.</p>
        <p>But what about custom hats? Or Bespoke Hats? Are they as straightforward as well, especially when being a salesman in it?</p>
            <p>To obtain a perspective on this, I managed to get an interview with a Sales Representative at the Optimo Hat Makers, stationed in Chicago.</p>

        <h3>How did you get into the industry?</h3>

                <p><em>F</em>or him, it was always the passion of well-made things, particularly Optimo, being a custom and Bespoke hat making company of fine hats. 
                    To enter the company, he called Optimo directly, obtaining an apprenticeship as a hat maker, before being promoted to the Sales side.</p>

        <h3>When Entering Optimo, what did you find challenging at first?</h3>

            <div class="p-container">
                <p><em>W</em>hen starting off in Optimo, what he found challenging was learning the product, 
                    such as the felts they use, how those felts are designed, and other details that are used in the “Bespoke World”.</p>
                <p>To overcome this, he kept learning all he can about the products. Later on, 
                    Optimo eventually created booklets, detailing the different materials Optimo uses for their hats.</p>

                <p>“<em>L</em>imitations” is how he described it. More specifically, how certain styles and materials do not match and are unable to be made. 
                    He further describes it like being a chef in a restaurant, where if someone orders an item, but wants it cooked a different way, it’s not possible.</p>
                <p>In terms of hats, limitations are mainly in the materials. As he describes it, some felts can become heavier based on colors alone, 
                    so in terms of this, some travel style hats are not possible to make if the color of the hat and felt makes it too heavy.</p>

                    which Optimo stands with via their custom and bespoke hats. Due to this, he is usually motivated by his “Passion for the product”.</p>

            <div class="p-container">
                <p><em>A</em>s he describes it, it is being in-person. If a client is there, in person, then the sales 
                    representative has his full arsenal to represent Optimo, such as their books of hats.</p>
                <p>Additionally, an Optimo Sales Representative can show the true tones and colors of a hat, rather than pictures through 
                    a screen that may differ in person. Alongside this, an in-person meetings allows the Sales
                     Representative to fully measure and nail down the correct sizing of a client’s head, which can usually take about 3 measurements.</p>
                <p>Outside of In-person meetings, technology has proven to be a useful tool as well, as tech has been able to allow custom molds to be made for a client.</p>
                <p>It also doesn’t hurt to have Zoom as well, for those that can’t make it into an in-person meeting.</p>

                <p>Due to Optimo’s foundations, their materials are created and shipped from Europe. Due to their high quality, a hatmaker in Optimo must 
                    be aware of how their materials are manufactured, as to not accidently misinform a client of Optimo’s quality and fabrics.</p>

                <p><em>D</em>ue to Optimo’s specialty being custom and bespoke hats, the Optimo considers themselves 
                    “Separate from the Competition”, due to other stores such as Goorin Bros and Sid’s selling hats made from other companies. 
                    Alongside this, he also states that Optimo sells about “5000 hats a year”, being custom and bespoke hats.</p>

                <p><em>A</em>s such, it is actually pretty straightforward in terms of measuring for a hat, especially when in-person. 
                    Due to Optimo’s hat making services, taking a physical measurement of the head results in about 99% accuracy.</p>
                <p>Additional factors that are easier in-person are also the shape of the client’s head. </p>
                <p>Alonside this, in order to ensure proper fitting as the website states, Optimo Sales Resprentatives utilize their arsenal of display hats,
                     allowing clients to try on different hats, and including “measuring about x3 times to confirm”.</p>
