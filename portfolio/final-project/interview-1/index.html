            <div class="p-container">
                <p><em>O</em>verall, the main thing that helps with motivation is the ability to represent Daniel George Custom 
                    Clothier’s suits, in a variety of ways.</p>
                <p>One of the main ways is by wearing the Suits made by Daniel George Custom Clothiers. Being able to 
                    represent, like a brand ambassador, the Daniel George clothing, and with this, being able to recommend 
                    different materials and colors over other available materials or colors, based on what the occasion is.</p>
                <p>Adding on, it is also motivating to present Daniel George Clothiers through other presentations, more 
                    specifically, Books. Being able to utilize handbooks and displays of a variety of different materials to show 
                    comparisons and make suggestions of what would look the best based on the event or purpose.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of this is the clients themselves. As long as both the clients and the clothiers show 
                    respect, the fittings and interactions are smooth sailing.</p>

        <h3>In the Chicagoland area, there are several other Men’s Suit stores, such as 
            Zeglio, Jacob Young Custom Clothiers, Montopoli Custom Clothiers, and Balani.</h3>
        <h3>Is it important to know what other Custom Clothiers / Competitions offer?</h3>

                <p><em>Y</em>es. It is important as a Suits Salesman to know what each competition offers.</p>
                <p>Being able to compare qualities of materials, and knowing price ranges based on suits and clothing from 
                    other competitors.</p>
                <p>Another helpful tool to know Daniel George’s materials vs others are image galleries.</p>
                <p>Usually on a custom clothier’s website, like Balani, there are image galleries displaying models and 
                    representing their clothing. By using these, it helps know what the competitors have the offer, as the 
                    image galleries help show what kind of quality and type of suits the competitors create.</p>
                <p>However, outside of comparison, this is an additional reason to know the competitors.</p>
                <p>That is when a sales person needs to recommend a competitor.</p>
                <p>To clarify, if say timelines won’t meet or Daniel George sales representatives are booked to the brim with 
                    clients, they might send a client to a competent competitor that they feel will get the job done well for a 
                    client.</p>

                <p><em>I</em>mportant measurements to know would be how to measure the chest, the coat waist, and pants waist.</p>
                <p>Though there are several more measurements that are equally as important, sometimes knowing a few 
                    measurements can help being able to determine other measurements</p>
                <p>Outside of this, a method, though not ideal, would be to figure out some measurements based on 
                    weight and height alone, although this is highly not recommended since proportions might vary based 
                    on each client, such as arm lengths, or disproportions in the body.</p>

                <p>Say the groom orders a suit. The suit takes 9 weeks for it to arrive, henceforth, the suit should 
                    arrive 2 weeks prior to the wedding.</p>
                <p>The bride and groom end up leaving to Europe for the wedding 3 weeks prior to the wedding.</p>
                <p>Well, the groom didn’t need the suit 2 weeks prior to the wedding, he needed it 3 weeks prior to 
                    the wedding.</p>
