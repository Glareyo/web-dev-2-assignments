                    1982 working with Tom James Clothiers, which he landed from “a friend of a friend”. </p>
                <p>As he continued his profession, he eventually continues his own, 
                    buying 3 bespoke tailor shops and developing from there into the Montopli Custom Clothiers today. </p>

                <p>“<em>F</em>inding new Clients” </p>
                <p>For him, from the start of his career to now, a big challenge that continuously presents itself is the gathering of new clientele. </p>
                <p>Beforehand, he would have to cold-call people, attempting to get clients via calling them in hopes of capturing an interest.</p>
                <p>Today, he says it is even harder, as now rather than cold calling, the current method is now creating a presentable presence on social media.</p>
                <p>A way to help overcome this continuous challenge is follow-ups. Calling old clientele to see if they are interesting inn continuing purchasing some additional suits.</p>

                <p>To clarify, getting to know the client via conversations and consultations: </p>
                <p> - What does the client like? </p>
                <p> - What is the client looking for? </p>

                <p>To further explain, he favors talking to the clients to get to know them, but using this, to “...pull them out of that comfortable zone...”. </p>
                <p>Alongside this, he focuses on making sure that the client gets what they want, and that they look good in what they buy. </p>
                <p>In a way, to hopefully have the client get compliments from other viewers. </p>

                <p>As described from the most difficult challenge of being a Suits Salesperson, he says that social media is one of the tools a Salesperson should utilize. </p>
                <p>As he reasons, it is mainly that “...people rely on feedback...”. </p>
                <p>To clarify, being able to present Montopoli and their suits in a presentable manner on an online presence. </p>
                <p>It is important to present excellent quality and presence, as he described the Custom and Bespoke clothing business as “...the easiest business to get into, the hardest business to keep.” </p>

                <p>In business and in general, different people want different things. This could range from more traditional suits and styles to more fancier and trendy suits and styles. </p>
                <p>As he describes, a pitfall that a Bespoke and Custom salesperson should avoid is sticking to only one style.</p>
                <p>The best way to overcome it is by being flexible and able to work with a wide variety of styles. This would help cover a wider array of clients, such as what works for them and their lifestyle, and henceforth to build a bigger clientele.</p>

                <p>The slope of the shoulders is important, as the determine if a client as peaked or square shoulders, and how they stand, which is the “...backbone of the garment...”</p>
                <p>But furthermore, he explains that to ensure a proper fit, “...A proper fit not only takes the measurements, but how you interpret those measurements...”.  </p>
                <p>Because of this, it is important to know how to interpret and communicate these measurements to the tailors, so that the client gets the proper fit, as bespoke garments take a bit longer to create vs Bin Garments </p>
